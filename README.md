# AIML

## Overview

AIML is a comprehensive repository focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) solutions, resources, and code examples. This project is my exploratory journey of projects during AIML Postgraduation course.

## Features

- Modular codebase for various AI/ML algorithms
- Example projects and tutorials
- Preprocessing and data handling utilities
- Model evaluation and visualization tools
- Integration with popular libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
- Sample datasets for quick experimentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
