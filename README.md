# AIML

## Overview

AIML is a comprehensive repository focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) solutions, resources, and code examples. This project is my exploratory journey of projects during AIML Postgraduation course.

## Features

- Modular codebase for various AI/ML algorithms
- Example projects and tutorials
- Preprocessing and data handling utilities
- Model evaluation and visualization tools
- Integration with popular libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
- Sample datasets for quick experimentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AIML.git
    cd AIML
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

Explore the available modules and notebooks in the `examples` or `notebooks` directory. You can run sample scripts as follows:

```bash
python examples/sample_classification.py
```

Or open a Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```
